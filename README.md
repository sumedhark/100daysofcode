### #100DaysOfCode

This challenge is something I have always wished to complete ever since I started my career as a front end developer. Through this challenge, I intend to build some pens and components using JS and JS related tools. I intend to build my skills as someone who can build a simple end to end website at the end of this journey. I fully intend to document my learning and experiments for future reference and upload some cool projects I build along the way into this repository.vI also have some dream projects that I intend to pick up once I finish this challenge. Cheers! :)
